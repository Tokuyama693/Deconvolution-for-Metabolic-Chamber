# Deconvolution for Metabolic Chamber
This is the Matlab code for implementing the ‘Extended Tikhonov’ and ‘Dimension Reduction’ methods, documented in the submitted manuscript by Insung Park & Kumpei Tokuyama, entitled “Algorithm for transient response of human open-circuit whole-room indirect calorimetry.”

Example data is in an Excel sheet “Appendix raw_data.xlsx”.

Data.txt files (R_output_O2, R_output_CO2, etc) are provided as an example to test the code.

To select oxygen consumption or carbondioxide production, select [O], or [C].
